In traditional (unidirectional) RNNs, information flows only from the past to the future, but bidirectional RNNs allow the model to consider information from both the past and the future at each time step.\n","\n","The idea behind bidirectionality is to capture dependencies in both directions, which can be particularly useful in tasks where context from both past and future information is important. Examples of such tasks include natural language processing, where understanding the context of a word may depend on both preceding and succeeding words.\n","\n","In a bidirectional RNN, the hidden state at each time step is computed by considering both the information from the past (forward direction) and the future (backward direction). This is achieved by having two separate sets of hidden states: one set computed from the forward pass and the other from the backward pass. The final hidden state at each time step is typically a concatenation of the forward and backward hidden states.\n","\n","Here is a simplified example of how a bidirectional RNN is implemented using Keras:\n","\n","```python\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Bidirectional, LSTM\n","\n","model = Sequential()\n","model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True), input_shape=(None, 28)))\n","model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))\n","```\n","\n","In this example, a Bidirectional wrapper is applied to an LSTM layer. The `return_sequences=True` parameter indicates that the LSTM layer should return the full sequence of outputs, and the Bidirectional wrapper ensures that the input sequence is processed in both forward and backward directions.\n","\n","Bidirectional RNNs are beneficial when the context from both directions is relevant to the task. They can capture more complex patterns and dependencies in sequential data, making them suitable for various applications, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. However, they also come with a higher computational cost compared to unidirectional RNNs."],"metadata":{"id":"x_BjA5RudWz4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# More in depth Example on Functional API"],"metadata":{"id":"VafJkGW83Am_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Multi digit dataset** (Multi digits MNIST)"],"metadata":{"id":"Ll3PVyI63TG7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers, regularizers\n","from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist"],"metadata":{"id":"E4TPsvDGdXll"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"LDFUFJ-B3_Om"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Sequential can only map one input to one output.
