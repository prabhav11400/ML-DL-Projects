NumPy is commonly used for numerical and mathematical operations in Python.\n","\n","2. `class Linear_Regression():`: This line defines a class named `Linear_Regression`. Classes are used to encapsulate data and behavior into objects, making it easier to work with and manage related code.\n","\n","3. `def __init__(self, learning_rate, no_of_iterations, tolerance=1e-4):`: This line defines the constructor method `__init__` for the `Linear_Regression` class. The constructor is called when you create an instance of the class. It takes three parameters: `learning_rate`, `no_of_iterations`, and an optional parameter `tolerance` with a default value of `1e-4`. The `self` parameter represents the instance being created.\n","\n","4. `self.learning_rate = learning_rate`: This line assigns the value of the `learning_rate` parameter to an instance variable `self.learning_rate`, making it accessible throughout the class.\n","\n","5. `self.no_of_iterations = no_of_iterations`: Similar to the previous line, this line assigns the value of the `no_of_iterations` parameter to an instance variable `self.no_of_iterations`.\n","\n","6. `self.tolerance = tolerance`: This line assigns the value of the `tolerance` parameter (or the default value `1e-4`) to an instance variable `self.tolerance`.\n","\n","7. `def fit(self, X, Y):`: This line defines a method called `fit`. This method is used to train the linear regression model. It takes two parameters: `X`, which represents the feature data, and `Y`, which represents the target values (labels).\n","\n","8. `self.m, self.n = X.shape`: This line retrieves the shape of the feature data `X` and assigns the number of rows to `self.m` and the number of columns to `self.n`. It's used to store the number of training examples and features in the instance.\n","\n","9. `self.w = np.zeros(self.n)`: This line initializes the weight vector `self.w` with zeros. The size of the weight vector depends on the number of features in the input data.\n","\n","10. `self.b = 0`: This line initializes the bias term `self.b` to 0.\n","\n","11. `self.X = X`: This line assigns the feature data `X` to an instance variable `self.X` for later use in the class.\n","\n","12. `self.Y = Y`: Similarly, this line assigns the target values `Y` to an instance variable `self.Y`.\n","\n","13. `for i in range(self.no_of_iterations):`: This line starts a loop that iterates for the specified number of iterations (`no_of_iterations`).\n","\n","14. `prev_cost = self.compute_cost()`: This line calculates the cost (error) of the model on the current data and assigns it to `prev_cost`. The `compute_cost` method calculates the mean squared error.\n","\n","15. `self.update_weights()`: This line calls the `update_weights` method to adjust the model's parameters (weights and bias) based on the current data and the cost.\n","\n","16. `current_cost = self.compute_cost()`: This line calculates the cost again after updating the weights and assigns it to `current_cost`.\n","\n","17. `if abs(prev_cost - current_cost) < self.tolerance:`: This line checks if the absolute difference between the previous cost and the current cost is less than the specified tolerance. If the change in cost is smaller than the tolerance, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the model has converged and further training is unnecessary.\n","\n","18. `self.update_weights()`: After the loop, the `update_weights` method is called one last time to ensure that the weights and bias are updated with the final parameter values.\n","\n","19. `def update_weights(self):`: This line defines the `update_weights` method, which calculates and updates the weights and bias using gradient descent.\n","\n","20. `def predict(self, X):`: This line defines the `predict` method, which takes feature data `X` as input and returns the predicted values using the learned weights and bias.\n","\n","21. `def compute_cost(self):`: This line defines the `compute_cost` method, which calculates the mean squared error (cost) between the predicted values and the actual target values.\n","\n","This class is designed for linear regression with gradient descent and early stopping based on a specified tolerance level. It allows you to train a linear regression model by calling the `fit` method and obtain predictions using the `predict` method. The model updates its parameters iteratively until it converges to a minimum cost."],"metadata":{"id":"wm0VoReod4wd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fRjIZe0Rd6ZX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
